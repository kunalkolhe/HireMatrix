---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd SkillZen-main
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

### 3. Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

# AI API Configuration
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key
# OR use OpenAI directly
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

# Optional: Resume Parsing (if using ApyHub)
APYHUB_API_KEY=your_apyhub_api_key
```

### 4. Database Setup

1. **Create a Supabase Project** at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)

2. **Run the Database Schema**:
   - Open Supabase SQL Editor
   - Copy and paste the contents of `database-schema.sql`
   - Execute the script

   This will create:
   - Tables: `jobs`, `assessments`, `questions`, `submissions`, `answers`, `scores`, `user_profiles`
   - Row Level Security (RLS) policies
   - Indexes for performance
   - Triggers for automatic profile creation

3. **Set Up Storage Buckets**:
   
   **For Profile Photos (`avatars` bucket):**
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard → Storage
   - Click "Create a new bucket"
   - Name: `avatars`
   - Make it **Public**
   - Click "Create bucket"
   - Add policies (or use SQL Editor):
     ```sql
     -- Allow authenticated users to upload their own avatars
     CREATE POLICY "Users can upload own avatar"
     ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
     WITH CHECK (
       bucket_id = 'avatars' AND
       auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
     );
     
     -- Allow public read access
     CREATE POLICY "Public avatar access"
     ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
     USING (bucket_id = 'avatars');
     ```
   
   **For Resumes (`resumes` bucket - Optional):**
   - Create another bucket named `resumes`
   - Make it **Public** (or Private with proper policies)
   - Add policies:
     ```sql
     -- Allow authenticated users to upload their own resumes
     CREATE POLICY "Users can upload own resume"
     ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
     WITH CHECK (
       bucket_id = 'resumes' AND
       auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
     );
     
     -- Allow recruiters to view resumes
     CREATE POLICY "Recruiters can view resumes"
     ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
     USING (
       bucket_id = 'resumes' AND
       EXISTS (
         SELECT 1 FROM user_profiles
         WHERE user_profiles.id = auth.uid()
         AND user_profiles.role IN ('recruiter', 'admin')
       )
     );
     ```
   
   **Note:** Resume file storage is optional. The parsed resume data is stored in the database, so the file storage is only for reference.

4. **Verify Setup**:
   - Check that all tables are created
   - Verify RLS policies are enabled
   - Test user creation to ensure trigger works

### 5. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
